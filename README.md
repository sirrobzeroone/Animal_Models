### Created by Sirrobzeroone

Simple animated animal models created in blender and exported in b3d format, created for my
own use in minetest but happy to share and anyone is free to use in any software/project.

Blend files and graphics are all created by me (Sirrobzeroone) you are free to use these for any
purpose as I release them under the CC0 Liscence. I'd appreciate a link back or something but as per 
CC0 no need to.
